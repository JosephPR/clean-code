          Genie a spirit of Arabian folklore, as traditionally depicted <br />
          imprisoned within a bottle or oil lamp, and capable of granting<br />
           wishes when summoned; figuratively, an agent of power or change<br />
            which is or may be released from containment.<br />
            Recorded from the mid 17th century (denoting a guardian or<br />
              protective spirit),
            the word comes via French from Latin base of genius. Génie was adopted<br />
            in the current sense by the 18th-century French translators of The Arabian Nights' Entertainments,<br />
            because of its resemblance in form and sense to Arabic jinnī jinn.<br />
            let the genie out of the bottle let loose or lose control of an<br />
             unpredictable force, start an uncontrollable chain of events. Sometimes
             in the form,<br /> you can't put the genie back in the bottle.
